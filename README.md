# 17Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-QuizGame
Day 17 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## BlackJack

BlackJack is the eleventh project of the eleventh Day of the bootcamp. Its purpose is to be something of a Capstone Projects that uses everything that has been taught so far like functions, if statements, loops and some colections. 

The actual project consists of a simple game of BlackJack following these guidelines: [List of Steps](https://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF) provided by the course.

It did not seam feasible to use ChatGPT's API on this project, but I took the oportunity to remember what I had learned on OOP (it is not perfect, I know, but I had to move on with the course). I also created tests for every class and functionality but for user interaction. For some reason, I have encountered some trouble splitting source and test code in this project, so I didn't.

## Project Structure

 - [src/](src/) - All files are in this folder in this project: `player.py`, `dealer.py` and `deck_of_cards.py` have the classes used in the project; `test_player.py`, `test_dealer.py` and `test_deck_of_cards.py` have tests for each class; `blackjack.py` runs the game.
